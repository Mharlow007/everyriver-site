        <h2>Team</h2>
        <p>The team will include you, in time. If you're willing. We are creating a way for everyone to contribute and enjoy the process. In these very early stages, there is a core of volunteers, including the founder, Mike Harlow. Mike has been a director of England's government bodies for land ownership and heritage. He's also a canoeist, river-fanatic and dreamer.</p>

        <h2>EveryRiver Atlas Limited</h2>
        <p>EveryRiver Atlas is the not-for-profit organisation behind the initiative. Every penny it receives in income (which is so far none, if you're wondering) can only be spent on the following objectives:</p>
        <h3>Objects</h3>
        <p>The Company is established for purposes that are exclusively not-for-profit and for the public benefit:</p>
        <ol class="object-list">
          <li data-label="(a)">To advance public understanding of rivers, canals, lakes, wetlands, aquifers, estuaries and related environments - covering scientific, cultural, historical and social aspects - by collecting, curating and communicating knowledge and data through storytelling, interpretation, publications (including digital), exhibitions, performances, broadcasts and other educational activities.</li>
          <li data-label="(b)">To increase responsible use and enjoyment and informed stewardship of those water environments by sharing knowledge, disseminating useful research and creating openly-licensed information resources and datasets that help people see, understand and value these places.</li>
          <li data-label="(c)">To build community participation by enabling volunteering and collaborative projects that gather, verify and share knowledge (including contributions to open platforms such as encyclopaedias and public datasets), and by offering training that supports those aims.</li>
          <li data-label="(d)">To collect, commission and exhibit creative works that interpret and celebrate these environments where this advances the purposes above.</li>
          <li data-label="(e)">To pursue such other purposes as are exclusively charitable according to the law of England and Wales and are connected with the preceding objects.</li>
