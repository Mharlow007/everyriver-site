      <p>We need you. This is not just for you. This is by you. EveryRiver is a not for profit organisation that only exists to enable people to come together to tell stories and grow people's undertanding and enjoyment of, well, EveryRiver everywhere. That breathtaking ambition may never truly be achieved, but, wow, imagine if we got close. Join the flow.
