        <h2>Why?</h2>
        <p>The more you understand a river, the more you enjoy it; the more you enjoy it, the more you care for it; and the more you care for it, the more you want to understand.</p>
        <p>We tell stories about rivers in order to give people that greater understanding, which feeds that virtuous circle of more enjoyment, care and thirst for understanding.</p>
        <p>The paper boat is a symbol to us of the wonderful adventures a river can take you on, if you let go.</p>

        <h2>What do we do?</h2>
        <p>We collect, connect and share knowledge about rivers — from science to folklore — so that everyone can understand and enjoy them.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="section">
        <h2>How do we do it?</h2>
        <p>We bring together existing information and make it useful and engaging. Where knowledge is missing or incomplete, we add to it — improving open sources such as Wikipedia and other public datasets to make river knowledge richer and more accessible.</p>

        <h2>We keep to our values</h2>

          <li>Let the river be the star</li>
          <li>Have fun</li>
          <li>Be kind</li>

        <h2>Who are we?</h2>
        <p>EveryRiver is a community of people who have come to love rivers for many different reasons. Many of us like walking, fishing, bird-watching, boating, canoeing or just sitting by a river and dreaming about the adventures it holds up and downstream. We want to enthuse others in the joy rivers bring.</p>
        <p>To give the community legal protection and good governance, we have established EveryRiver as a not-for-profit company limited by guarantee under English Law to own and run the data and infrastructure. Its purposes are limited to: [Insert purposes on institution of the company]. By law, we can only spend our income in pursuit of those goals.</p>
        <p>Were not a campaigning organisation. Our role is to inform, engage and inspire — helping everyone see the river more clearly. Every penny we receive will go on telling the story of every river in the world.</p>

        <h2>Origins</h2>
        <p>EveryRiver started with the River Thames and the small team of volunteers led by Mike Harlow, a previous director of Historic England and HM Land Registry.</p>
